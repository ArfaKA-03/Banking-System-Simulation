# Banking-System-Simulation using oops
# Banking System Simulation (OOP)

A console-based **Banking System Simulation** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project demonstrates how real-world banking operations can be modeled using classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## 📌 Features

* Create new bank accounts
* View account details
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money
* Check account balance
* Secure operations using account number / ID
* Menu-driven interface for easy interaction

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

* **Class & Object** – Account, Bank, Customer
* **Encapsulation** – Private data members with public methods
* **Inheritance** – Different account types (Savings, Current)
* **Polymorphism** – Method overriding for account-specific behavior
* **Abstraction** – Hiding internal implementation details

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Concepts:** OOP, STL (optional)
* **Platform:** Console Application
